# Hypothesis Testing — Bombay Hospitality Ltd.

This project demonstrates a **one-tailed hypothesis test (z-test)** to determine whether the average weekly operating cost of **Bombay Hospitality Ltd.** is higher than the model’s theoretical prediction.

## 🧮 Objective
To statistically verify the owners’ claim about increased weekly operating costs using Python.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
The company believes that its weekly operating cost exceeds the model prediction given by:  
**μ = 1000 + 5 × X̄**

Using a sample of 25 weeks, we test this claim at a **5% significance level (α = 0.05)**.

## 📊 Key Steps
1. **Define hypotheses:**  
   - Null Hypothesis (H₀): μ ≤ μ₀  
   - Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): μ > μ₀  

2. **Compute test statistic:**  
   - \( z = \frac{\bar{x} - μ₀}{σ / \sqrt{n}} \)

3. **Compare with critical value (zₐ = 1.645)**

4. **Decision & Interpretation:**  
   - Reject or fail to reject H₀ based on z-statistic  
   - Calculate p-value for additional confirmation
